                    <p>
                      Virtual Common Wealth (VCW) stands out as an innovative
                      approach towards addressing environmental challenges,
                      intertwining the concept of self-taxation with green
                      investing. VCW enables users to contribute proactively to
                      mitigating the Environmental Crisis by linking their
                      financial transactions, be it from credit cards, debit
                      cards, or other payment plans, to their carbon impact via
                      Plaid. However, not every transaction incurred a tax; only
                      those purchases with potential environmental implications
                      were taxed. For instance, gasoline purchases attracted
                      higher taxes due to their environmental toll, while
                      eco-friendlier choices like buying fruits went untaxed.
                      More than a monetary tool, the platform served as an
                      educational hub, raising awareness about the significance
                      of the VCW fund and contrasting its positive impact
                      against the environmental harm caused by its competitors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      VCW’s technical landscape was crafted using a medley of
                      modern technologies tailored to its unique requirements.
                      Ruby on Rails provided the core infrastructure, while
                      React Native offered a dynamic mobile user interface.
                      Plaid, pivotal for listing and categorizing user
                      transactions across various payment methods, was
                      seamlessly integrated. PostgreSQL was at the helm of data
                      tasks, ensuring efficient storage of user transactions and
                      their associated environmental tax values. Sentry ensured
                      real-time bug tracking, while Heroku's deployment
                      capabilities combined with Git’s version control ensured a
                      smooth development and deployment process.

                      My role in the VCW project was multifaceted and
                      instrumental to its development. While integrating Plaid,
                      we encountered a series of intricate challenges that
                      seemed insurmountable at first. Errors during integration
                      forced us to go beyond conventional troubleshooting,
                      leading to direct interactions with the Plaid Development
                      team. The depth of the challenges we faced was such that
                      even the Plaid team was prompted to delve deeper into
                      their own product. Through a series of intensive meetings,
                      both our teams collaboratively explored solutions, with
                      Plaid learning and refining from the unique hurdles we
                      identified. This collaborative effort culminated in Plaid
                      providing the necessary support, enabling us to finally
                      achieve a seamless integration. The entire process was not
                      just about overcoming technical barriers but also about
                      fostering collaboration between developers of different
                      products. This collaboration, with all its challenges and
                      discussions, emerged as a profound learning experience,
                      accentuating the importance of teamwork and cross-team
                      communication in my professional journey. The pride and
                      satisfaction of having had a significant dialogue with the
                      Plaid team and shaping a product for the better stand as
                      highlights of my involvement with VCW.
